# Digital Storage

The Refined R&D API adds the ability for your mod to integrate with the Digital Storage mod.

[NOTE]
====
If your mod has buildings that inherit from the base class (e.g., Constructor Mk4.. etc.) and just increases the crafting speed.
You do not need to implement this.
====

## Installation

1. Download the mod from our public https://gitea.hostxtra.co.uk/RefinedRD/sf_mod_refinedrdapi[repository].
2. Add the mod to your SML Project.
3. Add the RefinedRDApi dependency to your uplugin file.

[NOTE]
====
It is recommended to have this as a hard dependency however it will work without issues if the RefinedRDApi mod is not installed.
You will just need the RefinedRDApi mod added to your SML Project to create the data assets.
====

## Creating The Data Assets

Inside your mods content folder, create a new Data Asset by right-clicking on the content browser.
Hover over `Miscellaneous`, then `Data Asset`.

Once the `Pick Class for Data asset instance` window opens, search for `RRDA` you will see the following data assets classes:

* RRDADataAssetDSAdapterCover
* RRDADataAssetDSModAdapter
* RRDADataAssetDSItemFilter


## Adding Adapter Covers

If your building inherits the base game class but has changed the mesh, you will need to implement this data asset.

Select the `RRDADataAssetDSAdapterCover` data asset.

Change the `M Building Class` to your building class.

Add Covers to the `M Covers` variable; each element in the array will have `M Relative Transform` and `Is Conveyor`

This is the relative transform from the buildings origin to the Conveyor connection or Pipe Connection.

Digital Storage will add an Adapter Cover to this transform.

You can also choose if the adapter cover is a conveyor or a pipe cover.

[NOTE]
====
In the Refined R&D Api mod, we include both the Conveyor and Pipe adapter cover meshes, which can be used to get the correct placement on your building.
====


## Universal Adapter integration

If you have a custom building that adds an inventory and has a belt or pipe connection, you will need to add the `RRDADataAssetDSModAdapter` data asset to your mod.

Change the `M Building Class` variable to your building class.

Set up the adapter covers using the instructions above and change the `M Adapter Covers Asset` variable.

### Setting up Inventory Access

For each inventory in your building that you want Digital Storage to interact with, add them to the `M Inventory Access` array variable.

* Give the Inventory a display name that will be shown in the Universal Adapter UI in `M Inventory Display Name`
* Set the `M Inventory Name` to match the inventory name exactly on your building.
* Set the `M Inventory Index` to the Inventory Index. For example, if you have one Inventory, this will be 0.
* (Optional) Check the `M Use Adapter Inventory` variable to use the Universal adapter inventory. This is useful for when the building doesn't have an inventory and just uses peek/grab functions.

Next you must specify which Inventory slots Digital Storage can access on the Inventory.

For each inventory slot, add a new element to the `M Inventory Slots` variable.

* Set the `M Inventory Slot Index` variable to the Inventory Slot Index.
* Set the `M Inventory Slot Display Name` to a friendly name that will appear on the UI.
* Set the `M Interaction` variable to either `Import To Network From Slot` or `Export From Network To Slot`. This will let Digital Storage know which direction to transfer items, either move items into this slot or move items into the network.
* Set the `M Slot Item Forms` array variable for all the item forms that this slot can accept. This will limit the items forms shown in the Digital Storage UI.
* (Optional) Check the checkbox next to `M Item Filters` to enable the Item Filter array. This array allows you to specify which items should show in the UI for this slot.
* (Optional) Check the check box for `M Check Slot Item Filter` If this is checked, the Universal adapter UI will check to see if the inventory slot has an Item Filter and only make this item selectable in the UI.
* (Optional) Check the check box for `M Automatically Set From Slot Item Filter` if this is checked, the Universal adapter will automatically set the task to whatever item is filtered on the inventory slot. This disables the Item selection dropdown in the UI.
* (Optional) Check the check box for `M Slot Repersents Full Inventory`, if this is checked the `M Inventory Slot Index` must be set to `-1`. The entire inventory will be used based on this slot access settings.

### Network Connection

By default, the universal adapter will look for the first power connection component in your building and add a new Network connection to this location.

If your building doesn't have a Power Connection, then you can specify where the network connection should be.

Check the check box next to the `M Network Connection Relative Transform` variable and specify where the network connection should go.

[NOTE]
====
This will automatically add the Digital Storage Network Connection mesh to this transform.
