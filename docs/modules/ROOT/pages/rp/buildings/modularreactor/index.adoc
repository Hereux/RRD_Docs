= Modular Reactors

== Introduction:
Modular Reactor is designed to fit with the Modularity of the existing mod buildings like Modular Power.

Modular Reactors are the direct replacement to **ARC Reactors**.

In version 3.1.0 this will be the first iteration of Modular Reactors, future plans are to add different variants to the existing components.
One future concept is to add a different reactor chamber to allow more power production.


== Modules:

* Foundation
* Support Ring
* Reactor Chambers
* Cooling System
* Heat Shielding
* IO Ports
