= Deanorium Reactor Core

The Deanorium Reactor Core is a consumable item used as a high-efficiency fuel source for the Micro or Modular Reactor, providing substantial power output for advanced factories.

== Properties and Specifications

- **Type**: Fuel Component
- **Tier**: 7
- **Energy Value**: 300,000 MJ per core (at 100% overclocking, 60-second cycle)
- **Byproducts**: None
- **Unlocked in**: HUB Tier 7 (Refined Power Research)

== Description

The Deanorium Reactor Core is a specialized fuel designed for use in the Micro or Modular Reactor, high-output power generators. It offers significantly higher energy density compared to standard fuels like Coal or Fuel, making it ideal for late-game megafactories. Unlike other nuclear fuels, it produces no radioactive waste, simplifying power plant logistics. The reactor supports three modes: Power Only, Steam Only, and Power and Steam, with performance varying by overclocking and heat levels.

**Crafting Details**:
- **Crafting Time**: 120 seconds
- **Power Consumption**: 10 MW
- **Crafting Output Rate**: 0.5 cores/min
- **Overclocking**: 100% (adjustable 50%–250%)

== Usage

To use the Deanorium Reactor Core, place it in the fuel slot of a Modular Reactor. The reactor operates in three modes:

- **Power Only Mode**: Outputs power to the grid. At 100% overclocking (with Shield Mk3 and Cooling Rings), it produces 5000 MW, consuming 0.25 cores/min, 2 m³/min water, and 2 m³/min coolant, with a heat gain of 66.7%. At 150%, it produces 7500 MW, consuming 0.375 cores/min with a heat gain of 100%. Overclocking above 150% increases heat, risking emergency shutdown if max temperature is reached.
- **Steam Only Mode**: Converts water to Compressed Steam using internal heat. At 150% overclocking, heat levels stabilize, producing up to 196 m³/min of Compressed Steam (with 237 m³/min water and 60 m³/min coolant at 100% heat).
- **Power and Steam Mode**: Splits output between power and steam (see reactor page for details).

**Tips**:
- Automate Deanorium extraction and Advanced Reactor Case production to maintain supply.
- Use overclocking cautiously; above 150% increases heat (e.g., 133.3% at 200%), requiring more water (up to 240 m³/min) and coolant (up to 60 m³/min).
- Monitor heat levels via the Reactor Foundation screen and IO Modules to avoid shutdowns.

== Advanced Information

The Deanorium Reactor Core’s performance depends on overclocking and heat:

- **Power Output**: 5000 MW at 100% (up to 12500 MW at 250%).
- **Fuel Consumption**: 0.25 cores/min at 100% (0.625 cores/min at 250%).
- **Heat Management**: Overclocking above 150% (with coolant) increases heat, potentially leading to shutdown. Underclocking reduces heat.
- **Energy per Core**: 300,000 MJ (5000 MW × 60 seconds) at 100% overclocking.
